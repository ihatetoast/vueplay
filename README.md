# VueJS Play

## Rounds
Each folder is a round. That's what I call a new go at the tutorials. I take different notes each time. I rely less on the tutorial each time. 
When I practice a speech, I do not do it once. Sadly, I have sat through many speeches or Meet Up intros in which the speaker has clearly not gone over it. The worst thing an expert does is assume s/he can talk smoothly. Dear Cod, practice! That's what this is. I start over when I'm in the mood and reorganise as my understanding and grasp change. 
I keep old rounds because this is my version of version control.

I've thought about keeping this repo private, but then what is the point? This is how I learn. Never be ashamed of your rough drafts in any field.

Code on, Obi wan!
